I’m proud to announce that my debut album “Redshift" comes out February 23.

It’s been my lifelong dream to put out an album. In 5th grade, I drew the cover art for my (imaginary) first record. It took a decade to write enough songs I really believed in. It took a few years to refine and record them. I’m endlessly grateful for everyone who helped me make this dream a reality.

"Redshift" is about the restless search to resolve big life questions. About reaching for answers and certainties knowing full well they'll slip into the dark right at the last moment. It's about about getting older, leaving your 20s, being pulled into your 30s, and entering that stretch of life when possibilities begin to recede, no longer solely into the past, but also now into the future.

It’s about trying to find hope. In other people. For other people.

I put everything I had into these recordings. I can’t wait to share them with you.

It’s where I’ve seen so many of my favorite bands over the years I spent writing and recording my album. I can’t imagine a more fitting spot to commemorate its release.
