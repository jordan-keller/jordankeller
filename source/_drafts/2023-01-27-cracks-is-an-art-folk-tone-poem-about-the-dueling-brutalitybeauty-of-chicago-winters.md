### **POINT: Chicago Winters Are Brutal**Living on the eastern edge of the Central Time Zone means the sun (which barely drags its pale, hazy self up off the horizon) is in bed by 4pm for a month straight.

Driving is a death wish. Walking isn’t any safer.

No joke: last Monday, I went to take the dog out, slipped on our ice-slicked stoop, landed on my elbow, and tumbled meatily onto the salt and concrete.

In the winter, Chicago compels us: “Leave.”

### **COUNTERPOINT: Chicago Winters Are Beautiful**Snow flurries flitting like clouds of starlings through the sodium-orange streetlights. Leafless tree branches clacking in the winds that whip off the Lake. Hopscotching through a stranger’s footprints on an unshoveled stretch of sidewalk. Neighborhoods growing still and quiet.

Whether it’s the weather—or something personal that you can’t avoid by staying inside—there’s a camaraderie in facing miserable shit, individually, together.

“Cracks” is my attempt to put all of the above into song.
