I said 'Elizabeth, I know  
You can't wait to get out of here  
But I bet you look back when you're leaving'  
We were the lone lights on the road  
Drifting over county lines  
A bottle at our feet  
She said 'I know this place too well to lose myself  
and I just wanna lose myself again'  
She said 'we could die tonight  
but there's thousands yet ahead and I...  
I can't spend them here'

And I said, 'If you end up wrecking all alone  
So far from your name you can't be found  
And stranded like a cross on a gravel road  
Who'd be the one to bring you flowers?  
Who'd be the one to bring you flowers?'

I said 'Elizabeth, there is a grace  
In dying in the very place  
You were born'  
In the dashboard glow  
I swore i saw her eyes roll  
Or stow away a tear  
I said 'I know you way too well  
You'll never really lose yourself  
I bet we never get to lose ourselves again'  
But our love was setting slow  
Concrete around her bones  
She'd never end up here

But if she ends up wrecking when she goes  
So far from the home where she was bound  
Stuck standing like a cross on a gravel road  
I would be the one to bring her flowers  
I would be the one to bring her flowers  
I would be the one to bring her flowers
