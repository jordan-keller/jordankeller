The ninth drink delivers  
The lines you've prewritten  
And a voice like yours admits no wrong  
I swirl the ice inside my glass  
Drowning out the very last words  
I should say

I guess that  
Everybody's got a trusty lie they tell  
We fool ourselves with our own sleight of hand  
Everybody's got a trusty lie they tell to themselves  
Keep it in your head  
Careful now, don't let it wriggle out

One sincere sentence  
And six years is ended  
Instead my voice sounds strange when I speak to you  
How'd we wind up here?  
Why do I stay?  
Repeat it one last time "it's just for one more day"

Cuz everybody's got a trusty lie they tell  
We fool ourselves with our own sleight of hand  
Everybody's got a trusty lie they keep to themselves  
Sounds right your head  
Careful now…

Oh! If I met you here tonight for the first time  
I'd run the other way  
Oh! That's a good one!

Everybody's got a trusty lie they tell to themselves  
It's safe inside my head  
So careful now…  
Careful now,  
Careful now don't let it wriggle out
