All the trees flail their skeleton hands  
Warning us to double back  
We trudge through the boot prints  
Strangers cut through this  
And make it out in someone else's tracks  
Gentler weather held you together  
But this rough stretch rends your seams  
The sidewalks go jagged  
And the highways fracture  
It's hard to stay and harder still to leave

Cold creeps in the cracks  
The delicate can't last

The ice is gonna try to break us  
The ice is gonna try to break us up  
Yeah, the ice is gonna try to break us  
The ice is gonna try to break us up

Seven months ago, you were invincible  
All your miseries took so little strength to conceal  
But the winds found the weakness  
At your collar and sleeves  
In the promises you're keeping  
In your vow to not leave  
So if you shatter to pieces  
Fall into me  
I could hold you all together till you heal

Cold creeps in the cracks  
And widens them and weakens everything

The ice is gonna try to break us (Everything just falls apart here)  
The ice is gonna try to break us (Everybody falls apart here)  
The ice is gonna try to break us (But I was gonna try to heal you)  
The ice is gonna try to break you (I was gonna try to heal you)
