I hear the drum of a desperate moth  
Caught in the screen and glass  
The streetlights reach in through the curtain cloth  
Stretching the shadows cast

We pick ourselves from the city's teeth  
Throw some worn-out record on  
And each of our breaths is deafening  
In the silence between each song

Honey, don't love me please  
I'm not the man I thought I'd be

You say "Sometimes it's like I'm a guest  
'In hell everything is fine'"  
And the words are like stones through a hornet's nest  
"There's worse things to lose than time"

Honey, don't: love me please  
I'm not the man that I wanna be

Oh, and days burn down  
A pile of ashes on the ground  
And seasons that we wait it out  
Go passing in a breeze  
Days burn down  
And all the time you swore won't count  
It passes in a breeze and now  
And it's you and I alone

You say "I'd murder the fuckers  
I'd wring all their god-damned throats  
We'll never find cover  
But the demons aren't yours alone"

No, no, no, no  
No, no, no, mmm  
So let 'em out,  
Let 'em out on me, let  
'Em out"

Another night in our pleasant hell  
A swarm starts rising from my chest
