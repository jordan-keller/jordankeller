Let a light down through the clouds  
I swore this storm would break by now  
It billows and it drums  
But nothing ever comes

And my heart is wearing out  
Beaten like a cornered mouse  
Hoping for a sign  
A peace I just can't find

What if nothing ever comes?  
And everything is never enough  
To raise me from despair  
The weight when nothing's there

But still I wait my turn  
As if mercy might be earned  
And weren't some random pattern in the sky  
And still I sing this prayer  
Though I know there's nothing there  
There's a light I've felt  
But every time it fell  
My chin was tilted down

There must be something here  
There must be something here  
There must be something here
