Your uncle's on his shit again  
Four fingers of Midleton  
Nursing all his lone regrets  
Laughing off his eulogy  
That all the fools he used to be  
And all the men he might have been  
Wound up him instead

What will you have when you're looking back  
Once what's ahead is the distant past  
And all of the life that you left to chance  
Wastes away?  
Wastes away?

Sipping something on the rocks  
Spinning on a moonlit dock  
Numb as an old bruise  
I'm poring over everything  
I got regrets ahead of me  
But I'm wondering which ones I'll choose  
And which choose me instead

What will I have when I'm looking back?  
Once what's ahead is the distant past  
The sum of a life that was left to chance  
What'll I have? Man, I don't know

But I don't want to waste away  
No, I don't want to waste away  
No, I don't want to waste away  
No, I don't want to waste away  
To waste away anymore
