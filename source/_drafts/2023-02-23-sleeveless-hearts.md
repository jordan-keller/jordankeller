Your sleeveless heart  
It starts its fire for the night  
Kindles its conviction with some lines  
From books you've barely put a crease in  
You're in the dark  
And all lit up on your father's gin  
You nihilist, you feel no consequence  
Of needing nothing to believe in  
Born again… again  
You got a soul to sell  
You're so certain when  
It comes from someone else  
Yes, and you'll defend  
Every single part  
Screaming like you mean it  
From your sleeveless heart

You sleep past noon  
And wake with smoke still in your head  
The embers cool  
Those revelations left you cold again  
You're so desperate to believe  
In yourself or anything—anything at all  
But now they sound so hollow like in an empty cathedral hall  
The echoes of your own voice screaming

Born again… again  
Got no soul to sell  
When your sermon ends  
You're orphaned to yourself  
Nothing to defend  
Nothing to impart  
Nothing but the heat  
Of your sleeveless heart
