Do those sirens always blow?  
Did this time bomb finally explode?  
They want you all in cities now  
Herded on the coasts  
The center cannot hold  
And you'll be armed with nothing but your conscience when it goes  
If you make it out you can stay with me, yeah

Cuz this ain't the life I'll leave you, no no  
This ain't the life I'll leave

Did those shotguns start at dawn?  
I could'a slept through Stalingrad  
I let the neighbors hunt the land  
I know they're men of God  
The cellar's stocked for survival  
And I'll spend my last days arming for a war I will not fight in  
There's a lot that they can take from me, yes

But that ain't the life I'll leave you, no no  
That ain't the life I'll leave

You're hardly here when you're home  
It's like you're in retreat  
Like you see some threat I don't  
But I'm not afraid for my own life

I'm afraid for the life I'll leave you  
I'm afraid for the life I'll leave you

You'll be in your bunker too someday  
Yes, you'll be in your bunker too someday  
Yeah, you'll be in your bunker too someday  
Oh, you'll be in your bunker too someday  
Someday!  
Someday!
