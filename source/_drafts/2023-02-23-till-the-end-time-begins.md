Blue bleeds through the blinds  
Another new year  
The same old lang syne  
Come… come…

I saved your birthday cards  
"Your twenties," you wrote "are gonna be hard"  
But there's empty fifths in your trash  
And there's questions that I'm too terrified to ask  
Yeah…

Feel the harsh light  
Of the red morning sun  
You can wait your whole life  
For an answer that won't come

But if the chyrons start  
I hope you're walking the field, counting stars  
None of this Hemingway crap  
Just running the dog through the tall hissing grass  
You could stock your shelter till the big one hits  
How long do you figure an apocalypse is?  
And what'll you do till then?  
Till the end time begins? Till the end time begins?

Why'd you hunker down there on your own?  
Fighting demons like they're yours alone?  
'Cuz if you believe there's a shred of a chance we're not doomed  
Stop saving your soul and  
Put the damned thing to use

'Cuz yes I promise I'm a lot like you  
I've never been so sure of our certain doom  
But what do we do till then?  
Till the end time begins? Till the end time begins?
