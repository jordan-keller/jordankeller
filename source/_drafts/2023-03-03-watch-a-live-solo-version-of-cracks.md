Happy Bandcamp Friday!

Today, Bandcamp waives all their fees and passes them onto artists. So, if you’re the type of person who likes to pay musicians directly for their labor—[_perhaps for a carefully crafted album which that artist spent many years working on and which they only recently released_](https://theokaylakes.bandcamp.com/album/redshift)—today’s the best day to do that! You get an actual download so these songs wont disappear when your streaming site of choice goes belly up.

In totally unrelated news…

Check out this [live solo version of “Cracks,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCcHxWiCpZU) which I performed during our debut show at The Hideout back in August.

You can watch the video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCcHxWiCpZU). And/or you can pay for a download available exclusively on [Bandcamp](https://theokaylakes.bandcamp.com/album/debut-show-live-the-hideout-chicago-on-8-2-22). It won’t exist anywhere else, except in the private music library of a discerning music lover like yourself**.**

I’ve read (and been genuinely moved by) every single message. Countless times during the making of _Redshift_ I threw up my hands and thought, “Well… who gives a shit? There’s more than enough music out there! Who needs this?!”

It’s meant a lot to hear what your favorite songs are and what parts of the album you’re connecting with.

Thank you.

Cheers,

-JK
