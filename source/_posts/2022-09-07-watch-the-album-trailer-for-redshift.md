Well, this has been a long time coming.

We recorded the first note in [Shirk Studios](http://www.shirkmusic.com/) in Chicago on March 3, 2018. We wrapped the final recording session in Nashville on April 16, 2022. After more than four and a half years (and what feels like several lifetimes), we’re finally ready to start sharing what we were working on in all the clips you’ll see in the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Brk1bm_urxQ):

There’ll be plenty more specific details to come. But for now, I’ll leave you with the most important one: **Our debut album arrives this winter*.***
