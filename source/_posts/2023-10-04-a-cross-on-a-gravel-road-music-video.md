Hi, friends.

I hope you’re finding new tunes (and perhaps [**old faves**](https://listen.theokaylakes.com/redshift)) with which to romanticize your walks and drives this fall. If you’re looking for recommendations, [**I can offer you one at great length**](https://newsletter.theokaylakes.com/p/mike-violas-paul-mccarthy-is-an-open).

I’m kicking off spooky season with something I’ve been dying to share for almost a year: the music video for “A Cross on a Gravel Road.” I’m as proud of this video as I am the song.

Watch below (or over on [**YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/@theokaylakes)).

Some of the people I love most in this world made this with me on the back roads of southwest Michigan back in November 2022. In an upcoming post, I’ll share the full story of how we brought this to life.
