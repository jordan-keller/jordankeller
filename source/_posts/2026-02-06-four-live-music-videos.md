I joined a band 3 months before I left Chicago. My buddy, Charles, asked me if I'd be down to learn and record live performances of four songs with us and his two friends, Joe and James.

Of course, I get to join a fun band with great musicians and even better dudes that practices 5 minutes from where I live 3 months before I have to leave the city. :( :( :(

Two of the songs ("Lollicops" and "Pastoral Scene") were written by Brock Winthrop aka Alex Nichols (E1, Chapo). One, "Let's Start a War" is written by Charles Austin (E1, Solipse), who has a new album out TKINSERT HERE along with a funny music video TKINSERT. The other song is a cover by the band Asian Kung-Fu Generation.

I have a hard time picking a favorite: the brave political anthem ("Let's Start a War")? The deconstructed Sabbath of "Lollicops"? The hypermelodic janglepop of "Pastoral Scene"? Or the melodic joint-fitting of Asian Kung-Fu Generation
